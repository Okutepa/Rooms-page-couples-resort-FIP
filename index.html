            "I first came across the Couples Resort website  
            when I was looking for some weekend getaway  
            ideas in the summer. A few years back my mom,  
            grandma and I went away for the weekend to a  
            Muskoka resort that was an adult-only property.  
            While we all love kids, we found the atmosphere  
            different then our typical vacation stays and  
            quite enjoyed it"
